## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eli-iie/eventEaseBookingSystem.git
```

### 2. Create your `appsettings.json`
Create a file named `appsettings.json` in the project root with the following structure:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "<YOUR_AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING>"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

**Note:** Never commit real credentials or secrets to the repository. This file is excluded from git by default.

### 3. Exclude secrets from git
The `.gitignore` file already excludes `appsettings.json` to protect your credentials.

### 4. Run migrations and start the app
```sh
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```

### 5. Access the app
Open [http://localhost:5000/Bookings](http://localhost:5000/Bookings) or your Azure deployment URL.
